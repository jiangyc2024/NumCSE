LaTeX changes:
- changed to use PDFLatex
- changed to use biblatex
- change to use environments instead of commands

New structure of the folder:
- in Problems we place individual problems (i.e. exercises)
- in ProblemSheets we put individual problemsheets (which grab individual exercises forom Problems)
- in packages we put external packages
- in packages.tex we put all includepackages commands
- in commands.tex we put all definition needed
- we still use ../../notation.tex for math symbols
