\section{Inclusion of Codes}

Parts of a C++ code can be included by means of the \verb|\lstincludecpp| command:

Included with tag 2:

\begin{samcode}[C++ code]{cpp:1}{A demo code}
  \lstincludecpp[emph={NPDE},linebackgroundcolor={\lstcolorrange{2}{4}}]{test.cpp}{2}
\end{samcode}

Note \cref{l:1}! Included with tag 4, same file as \cref{cpp:1}.

\lstincludecpp[emph={Constant},linebackgroundcolor={\lstcolorlines{1,3,5}}]{test.cpp}{4}

\chapter{Summary}
\Label{cha:sum}

\cref{prb:test}: This is a test problem for demonstration only
