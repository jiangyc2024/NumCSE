# Tests of circuitimpedance.hpp

> Please note that the tests in this problem are *not* independent! You need to correctly implement a class to pass the test case corresponding to that class.

> The class *NodalPotentials* from _(3-5.d)_ is tested with two different setups: with $R=1, R_x=1$ for $V=1, V=5.1$ and with $R=2, R_x=3.5$ for $V=1, V=5.1$.

> The class *ImpedanceMap* from _(3-5.g)_ is tested with two different setups: with $R=1, V=1$ for $R_x=1,2,4,...,1024$ and with $R=1,V=5.1$ for $R_x=1,2,4,...,1024$.
