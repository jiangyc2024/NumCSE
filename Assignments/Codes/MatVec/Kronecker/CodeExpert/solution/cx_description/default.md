> For the task description of this exercise, please refer to [NCSE19_Problems.pdf](
https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NCSE19/HOMEWORK/NCSE19_Problems.pdf). 

> Open "kron.hpp" and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TO DO:`.

> When running your code, you will be asked to provide an input in the console below that indicates which part of "kron.hpp" you want to test. Integers from `0` to `4` are vaild inputs. Any other input will terminate the program without performing time consuming experiments.
