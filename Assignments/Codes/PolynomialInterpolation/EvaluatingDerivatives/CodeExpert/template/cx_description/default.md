# Problem 6-1: Evaluating the derivatives of interpolating polynomials

> For the task description of this exercise, please refer to [NCSEFL_Problems.pdf](
https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NumMeth/HOMEWORK/NCSEFL_Problems.pdf). 

> Open `eval_deriv.hpp` and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TO DO:`.

> The testing function of CodeExpert is only meant to be indicative. False negatives and false positives may occur.

> Always make sure your code compiles before running tests.
The templates provided do not always compile out of the box, and you may have to fill in some missing lines before attempting the problem at hand.
