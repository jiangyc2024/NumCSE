> Open "fftlsq.hpp", "main.cpp" and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TO DO:`.

> When running your code, you will be asked to provide an input in the console below that specifies the degree of the trigonometric polynomial; if no input is provided, 3 is used.
