> For the task description of this exercise, please refer to [NCSE20_Problems.pdf](
https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NCSE20/HOMEWORK/NCSE20_Problems.pdf). 

> Open "autofocus.hpp" and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TO DO:`.

> The testing function of CodeExpert is only meant to be indicative. False negatives and false positives may occur.

> When running your code, you will be asked to provide an input in the console below that indicates which part of "autofocus.hpp" you want to test. Integers from `0` to `4` are vaild inputs. Any other input will terminate the program without performing time consuming experiments.

> You may hand in any handwritten solutions directly to your teaching assistant. Alternatively, you may write them in the markdown document `written_solution.md`.
