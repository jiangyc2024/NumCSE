# WIP
- Look over codes in `Codes`, polish and comment them and then copy them as a CodeExpert version to `PolishedCodes`
- When done, `Codes` should be renamed to `Legacy` and `PolishedCodes` renamed to `Codes`.
- Make sure that everything compiles.
- For now, both subdirectories remain in the CMake hierarchy until everything is in `PolishedCodes`.

# Legacy README
## How to navigate this folder:

All codes used for exercises are in the subfolder `Codes`.

To obtain the codes for problem with name `<ProblemName>` of chapter `<Chapter>` go to the folders:
- for templates: `./Codes/<Chapter>/<ProblemName>/templates_nolabels/`
- for solutions: `./Codes/<Chapter>/<ProblemName>/solutions_nolabels/`

You can either `clone`the entire repository, or download the selected folder (`Download zip`).

You can find the  `.pdf` with the problems and the `.pdf`with hints and solutions on the [webpage](https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/HS16/NumCSE/).
There you can also download a self-contained bundle with template codes and solution codes for each "Problem Sheet".
