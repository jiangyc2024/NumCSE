# Problem 0-2: Gauss-Seidel iteration for a sparse linear system of equations

> For the task description of this problem, please refer to the exam document.

> Open `gaussseidelcrs.hpp` and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TO DO:`.

> You are free to edit `main.cpp`, but its content will not be graded. Your solution should be entirely contained in the header file.

> The "compile" button (gear symbol) has been repurposed to compile and run `main.cpp` with the header `backtrace.hpp` included. This allows for a more readable backtrace in case of assertion failures, but may result in slower compilation time. Please note that this mode is known to be somewhat unstable. If you encounter any problems, please use the regular "run" button (triangle symbol). 

> The testing function of Code Expert is only meant to be indicative and does not determine your grade. False negatives and false positives may occur. The tests are contained in `tests.cpp`.

> The problems are graded independently. If you are unable to complete the implementation of a function, you can still call upon that function in later tasks without penalty.

> In addition to the full Eigen documentation, see `EigenQuickReference.txt` for a quick overview of the available methods.
