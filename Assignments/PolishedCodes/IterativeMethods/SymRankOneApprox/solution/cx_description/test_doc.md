# Tests of symrank1.hpp

> Please note that the tests are independent. This means you can call functions from previous subproblems even if you did not solve them or failed to solve them.

> The function *symRankOneBestApproxSym* from _(9-14.a)_ is tested against the exact solution *z_bestApprox* and input data *MatrixXd M*.

> The function *computeKronkProdVecMult* from _(9-14.e)_ is tested against the exact solution *w_kronPro* and input data *VectorXd v, b*.

> The function *symmRankOneApprox* from _(9-14.g)_ is tested against the exact solution *z_approx* and input data *MatrixXd MM, double rtol, double atol*.
