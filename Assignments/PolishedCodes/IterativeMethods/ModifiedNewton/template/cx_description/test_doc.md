# Tests of modnewt.hpp

> `mod_newt_step_scalar` is tested with the arctan function and initial choice 1.

> `sample_nonlinear_solver` is also tested on the arctan function with initial choice 5.

> `mod_newt_ord` is not tested. Run the program to see its output.

> `mod_newt_step_system` is tested on a random s.p.d. matrix and a random coefficient vector whose values are positive; initial choice is zero vector.

> `mod_newt_sys` is also tested on the same random s.p.d. matrix and the random coefficient vector.

> `mod_newt_sys_test` is not tested. Run the program to see its output.
