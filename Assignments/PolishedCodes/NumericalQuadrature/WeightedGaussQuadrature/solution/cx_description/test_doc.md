# Tests of quadU.hpp

> Please note that tests in this problem are independent, i.e. you can have an incorrect implementation of a function from a subproblem, call it in another function that depends on it and the tests will pass when your implementation of this particular subproblem is correct.

> Test `quadU()` for its exactness where it is known, i.e. test for a polynomial of degree 2 ($f(x) = x^2$). Should give $\pi / 8$.
Also, test for another function, namely $f(x) = \frac{1}{2 + e^{3x}}$.
