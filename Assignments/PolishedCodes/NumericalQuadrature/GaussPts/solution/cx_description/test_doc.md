# Tests of gaussPts.hpp

> Please note that tests in this problem are independent, i.e. you can have an incorrect implementation of a function from a subproblem, call it in another function that depends on it and the tests will pass when your implementation of this particular subproblem is correct.

 > 'Eigen::VectorXd comp_g_gausspts': Test with f(y) = 1.
 
 > 'double testCompGGaussPts()': Check against expected results.
