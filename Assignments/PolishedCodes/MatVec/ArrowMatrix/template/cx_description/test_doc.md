# Tests of ArrowMatrix_functions.hpp

> Please note that the tests are independent. This means you can call functions from previous subproblems even if you did not solve them or failed to solve them.

> The function *efficient_arrow_matrix_2_times_x* from _(1-1.c)_ is tested in three ways: with linspaced vectors, with an identity matrix and finally with random vectors.

> The function *runtime_arrow_matrix* from _(1-1.e)_ is not tested. Run the program to see its output and the plot.
