# Tests of spai.hpp

> Note that you can use *spai* even if you did not implement it correctly. The tests will automatically call the solution of this function. However, your implementation of this function will also be tested.

> The function *spai* from _(3-6.b)_ is tested using two random matrices: one with size 400x400 and one with size 900x900.

> The function *testSPAIPrecCg* from _(3-6.d)_ is tested with $L = 1,...,5$.
