## 3-1 Hidden linear regression
- Added explicity Eigen:: prefix.
- Changed &f to &y in 3-1.e.
- Added TODO and START/END to each function.
- Improved comments.

## 3-3: Linear Data Fitting
- Added explicit Eigen:: prefix.
- Adjusted doxygen decorators where necessary.
- Changed name of plots from fit1.png, error1.png, fit2.png, error2.png to
  fit_normal.png, error_normal.png, fit_qr.png, error_qr.png
- Renamed `t` to `t_vec` according to the TODO in 3-3.a (did it for the whole
  problem)
- Added comments where beneficial
- Renamed `fit_plot()` to `fitted_function()` according to TODO in 3-3.c
