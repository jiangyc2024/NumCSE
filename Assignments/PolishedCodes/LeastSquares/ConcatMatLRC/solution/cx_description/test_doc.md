# Tests of concatmatlrc.hpp

> `eco_scd_concat` is tested assumin the matrices are ordered based on descending singular values. Efficiency requirements are not checked.

> `test_eco_svd_concat` is a testing function written by the student and is therefore not checked.

> `concat_low_rank_best` is tested for returning a correct output but *NOT* if the best approximation is returned.
