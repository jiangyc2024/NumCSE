# Problem 0-1: Simple operations with vectors and matrices in Eigen

> For the task description of this exercise, please also refer to [NCSEFL_Problems.pdf](
https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NumMeth/HOMEWORK/NCSEFL_Problems.pdf). 

> The purpose of this exercise is to learn to declare and initialize [Eigen::Matrix objects](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html), and to get familiar with some handy typedefs and methods.

> Open "MatrixClass.hpp" and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TODO:`.

> Read each function of the program carefully. The code will not compile until after the first task is finished, which is to include the necessary Eigen submodule.
