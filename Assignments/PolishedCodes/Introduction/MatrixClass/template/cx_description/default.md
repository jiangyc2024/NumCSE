# Tutorial: part 1/3
## The Eigen::Matrix template class

> The purpose of this exercise is to learn to declare and initialize [Eigen::Matrix objects](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html), and to get familiar with some handy typedefs and methods.

> Open "MatrixClass.hpp" and fill in the missing code in between the delimiters `// START` and `// END` according to the instructions preceded by `// TODO:`.

> Read each function of the program carefully. The code will not compile until after the first task is finished, which is to include the necessary Eigen submodule.
