===================== INSTALLATION OF FIGURE LIBRARY =====================

1. Possibility -- local installation:
To install the Figure library correctly with CMake follow these steps:
(Make sure you have CMake installed!)

Linux/Mac:
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ sudo make install

Windows:
   Almost same procedure as above:
   - open a terminal with administrator rights
   - do the same as above but without the 'sudo'

2. Possibility -- no installation:

As this is a header only library it is enough to include the file called 'Figure' from the 'src' directory when you're compiling your projects.
